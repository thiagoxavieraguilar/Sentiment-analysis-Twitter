# Sentiment analysis Twitter
This repository contains a Python script that performs sentiment analysis on tweets using the Twitter API and TextBlob. The script uses the tweepy library to connect to the Twitter API and retrieve tweets based on a specified query. The tweets are then pre-processed and cleaned using the pandas library.

The script uses the TextBlob library to analyze the sentiment of the tweets, and it uses the polarity score to classify tweets as positive and negative.
